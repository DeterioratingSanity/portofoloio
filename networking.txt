		<p class="bio">A Local Area Network, or LAN, connects devices over a short range and within a single setting or environment. They are frequently used in
			academic settings or workplaces to connect multiple users to single iterations of a peripheral device, whose cost prohibits a 1-to-1 rate alongside
			computer desktops.

		<p class="bio">A Wide Area Network, or WAN, connects multiple independant LANs to one another in order to promote communication between individuals and the
			sharing of information between machines over distances that would be prohibitive were it a measure of real-world travel. A WAN can be used to extend
			range over which an online business can conduct sales or to connect information repositories between regions. 
		</p>
		<p class="bio">One of the most common and widely-used WANs is the internet itself.

		<h3>Coaxial Cable</h2>
		<img class="imgex" src="https://www.wireandcabletips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Coaxial-cable-large.jpg" width="30%">
		<p class="bio">A coaxial cable, first patented in 1880 by one Oliver Heaviside, is constructed of a core wire, surrounded in turn by an insulator, a copper shield,
			and an outer container of some insulating material. It conveys binary through on/off electrical signals with an immense frequency, though it suffers from weaknesses in outer 
			insulation, as unrelated signals can leech into the line and impede the desired signal, and that signal may also have opportunity to leech out, weakening
			the reciever's impression of it and hampering signals around the area it leeches out.

		<h3>Twisted Pairs</h2>
		<img class="imgex" src="https://www.networkcablinglosangeles.com/wp-content/themes/networkcablinglosangeles/images/unshielded_cable.jpg" width="30%">
		<p class="bio">A twisted pair cable is constructed of two interwoven lines which convey off/on binary impulses electrically. The interwoven design prevents
			the leeching which occurs in coaxial designs by holding roughly equal currents, and their interwoven position places them equally close to the source of
			unwanted signals, so that the difference between them can be interpreted as the desired signal by the reciever. If multiple twisted pairs are placed in
			proximity to one another, most frequently in a common bundle, shared rates of twisting may prove detrimental to both impacted pairs, as the twist rate
			is a large part of the process which protects them from unwanted signal incursion.

		<h3>Fiber Optic</h2>
		<img class="imgex" src="https://www.cvalley.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Fiber-Cable-Image-Square-300x200.jpg" width="30%">
		<p class="bio">A fiber-optic or optical-fiber cable is constructed from one or many glass "optical fibers" which are used to convey binary through the
			means of <i>light</i> surrounded by a casing. As it moves at literal light-speed, it is capable of incredible rates of communication. As light diffuses
			as it moves, over time the light becomes fainter, reducing the ammount which reaches the reciever. This is compounded that the number of connections along 
			the cable's route also reduce the signal by the time it reaches the reciever.

		<h3>History of the Internet</h2>
		<img class="imgex" src="https://thereboot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Internet-History_Header-opt.jpg?w=750" width="30%">	
		<p class="bio">In the 1960s, computers were massive and sluggish, and only the most specialized of situations could warrant their employment towards a project
			or endeavor. They were completely isolated, and files they held could only be accessed directly from their real-world location. Some report fears of Mutually Assured
			Destruction, which ran rampant during those middle years of the Cold  War, led governmental research bodies to build networks that would maintain the conveyance
			of crucial information after the bombs fell-- If you hadn't noticed, this didn't happen.
		</p><br>
		<p class="bio">Others suggest that there was a much tamer demand to form early networks- That the few computers in existance at the time needed a better way to delineate tasks,
			thereby levelling access by those researchers or other antique brainiacs who were obliged to use computers in that way (and whose research contributed to the way we use
			computers in the modern day).
		</p><br>
		<p class="bio">All the same, this network existed, and despite its few connections, others took inspiration and built little networks of their own.  It was still a small,
			isolated, and specialized affair, but now one needn't travel across the nation to look at a spreadsheet held on a certain computer. In 1983, Transfer Control Protocol / Internetwork
			Protocol (TCP/IP) was established, allowing interaction between these networks. Such, the internet, though not quite as we now concieve it, came to be.
		</p><br>
		<p class="bio">Five years later, a British researcher at CERN named Tim Berners-Lee conceptuallized the World Wide Web, whcih allowed the access of documents through hypertext from any connection
			point to the network. Built on this foundation, the next 30 years have heralded colossal innovations upon those humble beginnings. Blogs, recipe sharing sites, online business conduction and
			communication, as well as inane facets of modernity like the social media platforms of today, and the world is more closely tied together than at any previous point in recorded history.
